# Trello clone

This repo contains code for a trello clone. This project will help me improve on my React
and TypeScript skills.

## UI structure
The Trello clone app comprises of an `AppContainer` that has `ColumnContainers` nested inside. Each ColumContainer comprises of nested `ColumnTitle` and `Cards` representing tasks in a top down list. Each of thes cards can be drag and moved to every other column next to it.
